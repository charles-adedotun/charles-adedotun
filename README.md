# Charles Adedotun

DevOps/SRE & AI Platform Engineer specializing in cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes orchestration, and AI-augmented development tooling. I build production-grade systems that scale and empower teams to ship faster.

## Quick Evaluation (3 min)

1. **K8s + AI integration** → [kubepulse](https://github.com/charles-adedotun/kubepulse) - run `make dev` or `docker-compose up`
2. **CLI tooling** → [dockerlab-manager](https://github.com/charles-adedotun/dockerlab-manager) - check `homelab_manager/cli.py` for Click patterns
3. **MCP expertise** → [notifications-mcp-server](https://github.com/charles-adedotun/notifications-mcp-server) - production MCP server with PyObjC

## What I Do

### Platform & SRE
Building and maintaining resilient infrastructure at scale. I focus on:
- Infrastructure as code with Terraform and Kubernetes
- Observability pipelines using Prometheus, Grafana, and modern logging stacks
- Homelab environments for testing and R&D
- Incident response and reliability engineering practices

### Agentic & AI Tooling
Exploring the frontier of AI-augmented development workflows:
- Building Claude Code sub-agents for complex, multi-step automation
- Developing MCP servers that extend Claude Desktop capabilities
- Creating tools that amplify developer productivity through intelligent automation
